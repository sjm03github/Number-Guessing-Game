# Number-Guessing-Game
Number Guessing Game mini-project in Java Language.

A number guessing game is a simple yet engaging program where the computer generates a random number, and the player's objective is to guess that number correctly. Below is the theoretical framework for creating a number guessing game in Java:

1. **Random Number Generation:**
   - The game begins by generating a random number within a specified range. In Java, you can use the `Random` class to achieve this. The range can be defined by setting a lower and upper bound.

2. **Guess Evaluation:**
   - Compare the player's guess with the randomly generated number to determine if it's higher, lower, or equal. Provide appropriate feedback to the player based on the comparison.

3. **Loop for Repeated Guesses:**
   - Allow the player to make multiple guesses by placing the guessing process inside a loop. The loop continues until the player guesses correctly.

4. **Counting Guesses:**
   - Keep track of the number of guesses the player makes. This count can be used to provide feedback on the player's performance.

5. **End of Game:**
   - When the player guesses the number correctly, the game ends, and a victory message is displayed. The player's score, the actual number, and the number of attempts can be shown.

6. **Play Again Option:**
   - Optionally, offer the player the choice to play the game again. If they decide to continue, generate a new random number and reset the guess count.

Below is the Snapshot of the Game.
